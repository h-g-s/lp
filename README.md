LP     {#mainpage}
==

LP is a simple and lightweight solver-independent C/C++ wraper to
Mixed-Integer Programming (MIP) solvers. It currently supports COIN-OR
CBC, GLPK, CPLEX and GUROBI. It can be called from any C 89 (or higher)
compatible compiler. I created lp because as someone used to the C based
CPLEX callable libeary, I was frustrated with the complex object oriented
framework that one had to master to successfully use the COIN-OR CBC
integer optimizer (OSI, CGL, CBC...).
